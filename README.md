Steps to run c++ code in sublime text:- 
1) open sublime text
2) slipt the screen into 3 using
option + command + 3
3) open inputf.in in second window (used to give inputs to the program)
4) outputf.in in the third window (outputs will be generated in this file)
5) run the program using command+b 
6) we need to also create a new build system (video followed -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlx7gmt3lBU&ab_channel=Luv)
