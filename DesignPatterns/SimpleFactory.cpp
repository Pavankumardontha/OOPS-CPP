/*
Letâ€™s say in future, if PaymentMethodFactory has to make a new type of 
payment method called wallet payment.To adopt this new requirement, we 
have to change getPaymentMethod method and add one if condition for wallet 
case, define a new class and also add a new type in the enum. If again new 
kind of payment method is introduced, then again one more case needs to be added. 
This will be a violation of Open Close Principle of SOLID principles. This can 
be overcomed using Factory Method design pattern.
We have 3 methods 
1) Simple factory ( we have seen this in the above example)
2) Factory method 
3) Abstract Factory method

Simple Factory is a factory in the form of a class.For every new subclass of PaymentMethod 
you will have to edit if else conditions in the getPaymentMethod method. This is a violation 
of the Open/Close Principle.

Factory Method is a factory in the form of a method (hence the name). This doesn't violate 
the Open/Close Principle since you deal with change by extending and not by modifying code.
